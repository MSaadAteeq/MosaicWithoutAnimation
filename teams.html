                <p class="member-description">
                  John Cosenza is a forward-thinking executive with over 25
                  years of experience in global markets. He is widely recognized
                  for his deep expertise in agency and risk trading, electronic
                  product innovation, and market structure. Throughout his
                  career, he has built and scaled platform businesses that help
                  clients achieve their performance objectives.
                  <br /><br />
                  He previously served as Head of Electronic Trading for the
                  Americas and Global Co-Head of Product, Research, and
                  Development at Goldman Sachs. There, he led the firm’s
                  electronic trading franchise and oversaw the growth of its
                  U.S. equity ATS from #11 to #2—establishing it as one of the
                  largest market centers globally. He also sponsored key
                  strategic investments and served on the boards of IEX, BIDS
                  Trading, and Purestream ATS.
                  <br /><br />
                  Prior to Goldman Sachs, John was Head of Electronic Trading
                  and a member of the Equities Operating Committee at Cowen
                  Group, where he led the firm into the electronic trading
                  league tables for the first time. Before that, he was Head of
                  the business unit at ATM and a member of its Executive
                  Management Committee, instrumental in the firm’s successful
                  acquisition by Cowen in 2012. Earlier in his career, he held
                  trading roles at Deutsche Bank, Robertson Stephens, and UBS.
                  <br /><br />
                  With deep operating experience across global banks, fintech
                  platforms, and agency brokers, John brings a unique ability to
                  align strategic vision with execution. He is known for his
                  leadership, his ability to synthesize the big picture while
                  commanding the details, and a consistent track record of
                  building high-performing teams across distribution, product,
                  and engineering.

                  <br /><br />
                  Prior to Clearpool, Joe was EVP at GAIN Capital, overseeing

                  With a strong track record of innovation and leadership, Joe
                  has been at the forefront of electronic trading evolution,
                  consistently delivering cutting-edge solutions that enhance
