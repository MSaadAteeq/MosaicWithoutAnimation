                Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device’s location, which can be
                either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the
                device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
                allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling
                your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use
                certain aspects of the Services.

            <p><strong>In Short: </strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational
              and technical security measures.</p>
            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
              protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
              to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
              can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that unauthorized third parties
              will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, copy, or modify your information.
              Transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
              the Services within a secure environment.

              </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>In Short: </strong>Depending on where you reside, such as the European Economic Area (EEA),
              United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control
              over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending
              on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

            <p>
              In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data
              protection laws. These include the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal
              information; (ii) request correction of your personal information; (iii) request erasure of your personal
              information; (iv) restrict the processing of your personal information; (v) withdraw consent; (vi)
              transfer your personal information; and (vii) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a
              decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will
              inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain
              circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are located in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, you also have the right to complain to your local data
              protection authority at https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en,
              https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/, or https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/en. If you wish to exercise any of the

              We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
              right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
              measure to ensure that, for example, personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right
              to receive it or that information is not deleted without authorization. We may also contact you to ask you
              for further information in relation to your request in order to speed up our response.

              recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
              browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
